	CustomElementTs is a minimalist JavaScript/TypeScript library for the creation of <strong>single-page web applications</strong>.<br>
	It allows you to <strong>create your own custom HTML elements</strong> and assign a <strong>state</strong> and <strong>behavior</strong> to them.

		<p class="lead">
			Vue.js, React, Angular and most other reactivity libraries and frameworks are much criticized.<br>
			<br>
			Some for their heaviness, slowness, difficulty to use, lack of cleanliness or difficulty to maintain a project through time.<br>
			<br>
			Developers would like to have a minimalist tool, compatible with all projects that doesn't require any particular dependency.

			<h2 is="tilted-block">What solutions does CustomElementTs offer?</h2>
		</div>
		<p class="lead">
			JavaScript already embeds all the features needed to design reactive web components.<br>
			You don't need CustomElementTs or any other framework! üòÑ<br>
			Simply use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements">custom elements</a> ü•≥<br>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Cross-browser (web standard) for creating and extending reusable components.</li>
			<li>Requires no library or framework to get started. Vanilla JS/HTML FTW!</li>
			<li>Provides a familiar programming model. It's just DOM/CSS/HTML.</li>
			<li>Works well with other new web platform features (Shadow DOM, <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>, CSS custom properties, etc.)</li>
			<li>Tightly integrated with the browser's DevTools.</li>
			<li>DOM allows you to dynamically modify page elements, no need for a virtual DOM.</li>
			<li>Leverage existing accessibility features.</li>
			<li>JavaScript functions to manipulate the browser history allow to react dynamically to url changes.</li>
			<li>No virtual DOM. Your app starts fast and stays fast.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="lead">
			In short, you don't need complex frameworks to create web applications with components and reactivity.<br>
			But with custom elements, the code is <strong>very verbose</strong> and projects easily become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code">spaguetti code</a> üçù<br>
			<br>
			CustomElementTs is useful to you only for simplification and readability.<br>
			It is nothing more than custom elements with some optional prefabs to make animations.
