## What problems exist?
React, Angular and most other reactivity libraries and frameworks are much criticized.\
Some for their heaviness, slowness, difficulty to use, lack of cleanliness or difficulty to maintain a project through time.\
Developers would like to have a minimalist tool, compatible with all projects that doesn't require any particular dependency.

## What solutions does CustomElementTs offer?
JavaScript already embeds all the features needed to design reactive web components.\
You don't need CustomElementTs or any other framework! :laughing:

- Cross-browser (web standard) for creating and extending reusable components.
- Requires no library or framework to get started. Vanilla JS/HTML FTW!
- Provides a familiar programming model. It's just DOM/CSS/HTML.
- Works well with other new web platform features (Shadow DOM, ``<template>``, CSS custom properties, etc.)
- Tightly integrated with the browser's DevTools.
- DOM allows you to dynamically modify page elements, no need for a virtual DOM.
- Leverage existing accessibility features.
- JavaScript functions to manipulate the browser history allow to react dynamically to url changes.
- No virtual DOM. Your app starts fast and stays fast.

### Yes, but these features are very verbose.
You don't need complex frameworks to create real web applications with components and reactivity.\
CustomElementTs is useful to you only for simplification and readability.
